# Alzheimer's Disease Classification from MRI Scans (EfficientNet-B0)

This project is a high-accuracy medical imaging solution designed to classify Alzheimer's Disease stages using MRI scans. It was developed not just as a research project, but as a pioneering MedTech Startup solution for the Uzbekistan market, tailored to meet specific client requirements.

## 🚀 Overview

Early detection of Alzheimer's is critical for effective patient management. This model leverages deep learning to categorize MRI scans into four distinct stages:

•	**Non-Demented** (Healthy)

•	**Very Mild Demented**

•	**Mild Demented**

•	**Moderate Demented**

## 📊 Dataset

The model was trained on the Alzheimer's Multiclass Dataset from Kaggle.

•	Volume: 44,000 JPG images.

•	Structure: Balanced and augmented across 4 classes to ensure robust performance and prevent model bias.

## 🧠 Technical Architecture & Training

I utilized the EfficientNet-B0 architecture, known for its optimal balance between computational efficiency and high accuracy—making it ideal for deployment in clinical environments.

•	**Framework**: PyTorch

•	**Optimizer**: Adam (lr=0.001)

•	**Loss Function**: CrossEntropyLoss

•	**Scheduler**: StepLR (step_size=2, gamma=0.1)

•	**Training**: 6 Epochs (Google Colab environment)

## 📈 Performance Results

The model achieved state-of-the-art results on the test set:

•	**Test Accuracy**: 99%

•	**Test Loss**: 0.033

•	**Train Accuracy**: 99.8%

## Confusion Matrix Analysis

The confusion matrix demonstrates an exceptional classification performance with high precision across all stages:

•	**Mild Demented**: 2,494 correct predictions with only 6 minor misclassifications.

•	**Moderate Demented**: Near-perfect detection with 2,499 correct predictions out of 2,500.

•	**Non-Demented**: 2,456 correct predictions. A minor overlap of 32 cases is observed with Very Mild Demented, which is medically expected due to the subtle physiological transitions between healthy and early-stage Alzheimer's in clinical practice.

•	**Very Mild Demented**: 2,485 successful classifications, showing strong model robustness.
